<!-- Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal e-commerce website with React, Zustand, and Node.js.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node.js, MongoDB, data structures, and algorithms to become a full-stack developer.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects or small real-world apps to gain more experience.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with system design and best practices in large-scale applications.
